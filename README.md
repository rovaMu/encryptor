# encryptor
Python ecription program
If you want to encrypt a program just double press on encryptor and chose the file you want to encrypt.
The program will generate 2 files 1 file is the content of the encripted file and another file is for extension ex:(.rar : .txt).
If you want to decrypt the files just put the 2 files generated automaticaly in the same folder as decryptor.py an double tap on decryptor.py.


That's it and i hope you like my program.
